description: HERE I offer to the public the life of Jean-Henri Fabre; at once an admiring
  commentary upon his work and an act of pious homage, such as ought to be offered,
  while he lives, to the great naturalist who is evento-day so little known. Hitherto
  it was not easy to speak of Henri Fabre with exactitude. An enemy to all advertisement,
  he has so discreetly held himself withdrawn that one might almost say that he has
  encouraged, by his silence, many doubtful or unfounded rumours, which in course
  of time would become even more incorrect. For example, although quite recently his
  material situation was presented in the gloomiest of lights, while it had really
  for some time ceased to be precarious, it is nome the less true that during his
  whole life he has had to labour prodigiously in order to earn a little money to
  feed and rear his family, to the great detriment of his scientific inquiries; and
  we cannot but regret that he was not freed from all material cares at least twenty
  years earlier than was the case.
